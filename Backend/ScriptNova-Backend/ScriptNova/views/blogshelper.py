# VOICE & STYLE RULES:
# - Contractions everywhere: don't, it's, you'll, can't, won't, that's, we're.
# - Sentence lengths must vary wildly and unpredictably. Some sentences: 4-6 words. Some: 20-28 words. No consistent rhythm — ever.
# - Paragraph lengths vary too. One paragraph: 2 sentences. Next one: 5-6 sentences. Don't be consistent.
# - Simple vocabulary only. If a shorter, plainer word exists — use it. Always.
# - Add one rhetorical question somewhere in the middle. Make it feel natural, not forced.
# - Add one very short punchy sentence (3-5 words max) somewhere it lands like a gut punch.
# - One sentence somewhere should trail off or end slightly abruptly, like the writer moved on mid-thought.
# - Occasionally start a sentence with "And", "But", or "So" — real writers do this.
# - One slight word repetition across paragraphs is fine. Real writers repeat themselves.

# BANNED WORDS & PHRASES — do not use any of these anywhere:

# in this article, let's dive in, navigate, multifaceted, embark, robust, cutting-edge,
# it goes without saying, at the end of the day, having said that.

# BANNED PATTERNS:
# - Do NOT use em dashes (—) more than once total.
# - Do NOT write 3 sentences in a row starting with "The" or "This".
# - Do NOT write 3+ consecutive sentences of roughly the same length.
# - Do NOT use textbook definitions ("X is defined as...", "X refers to...", "X can be described as...") — turn them into human observations instead.
# - Do NOT end with a generic motivational conclusion. End naturally, like a real writer would.
